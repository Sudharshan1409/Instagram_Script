# Instagram Unfollower Tracker

A Python script to automate the process of tracking Instagram followers and identifying users who don't follow you back.

## Features

- **Automated Data Fetching**: No more manual copy-pasting from the browser console. The script automatically fetches your followers and following lists.
- **Unfollower Tracking**: Keeps a history of your followers and notifies you of who has unfollowed you since the last run.
- **Celebrity/Whitelist Management**: Interactively prompts you to add non-followers to a `celebrities.json` list, so you can ignore them in future checks.
- **All-in-One**: A single script that handles everything, making the process simple and efficient.

## Setup and Configuration

Follow these steps to get the script up and running.

### 1. Install Dependencies

This project requires Python 3 and the `requests` library. Install the dependency by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Your Credentials

Before you can run the script, you need to provide your Instagram username and session ID.

Open the `main.py` file and update your username in the `CONFIGURATION` section at the top:

```python
# --- CONFIGURATION ---
# 1. Your Instagram username
USERNAME = "your_instagram_username"
```

The script will **prompt you for your Instagram `sessionid`** when you run it. Alternatively, for non-interactive use, you can set it as an environment variable named `INSTAGRAM_SESSION_ID`.

#### How to get your `sessionid`:

1.  Open your web browser (like Chrome or Firefox).
2.  Go to [www.instagram.com](https://www.instagram.com) and log in.
3.  Open the **Developer Tools** (usually by pressing `F12` or right-clicking the page and selecting "Inspect").
4.  Go to the **"Application"** tab (in Chrome) or **"Storage"** tab (in Firefox).
5.  On the left side, expand the **"Cookies"** section and select `https://www.instagram.com`.
6.  Find the cookie named `sessionid` and copy its value. It is a long string of characters.
7.  When the script prompts you, paste this value into your terminal.

## Usage

Once the setup and configuration are complete, simply run the script from your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The script will guide you through the rest of the process.

## File Descriptions

- **`main.py`**: The main script that contains all the logic.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A list of the Python dependencies required for the project.
- **`celebrities.json`**: A list of users you follow who don't follow you back, but who you want to exclude from the checks (e.g., celebrities, brands). You can manage this list interactively through the script.
- **`followers_history.json`**: This file is automatically generated and updated by the script to keep track of your followers over time for the unfollower-checking feature.
